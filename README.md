**Eliott Tempez** - Université Paris Cité

This internship was carried out from January 2025 to July 2025 at the Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC) under the supervision of **Anne Lopes**.

### Internship Steps (subfolders):  
- Global functions (`my_functions`)  
- Generation of supplementary figures for the report (`supp_figures`)  

**Program Execution:**  
- Use of Dense on *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* to get familiar with the tool (`1_dense_yeast`)  
- Study and visualization of input data (`2_initial_data_analysis`)  
- Conversion of `genbank` files in the input data to `gff` files (`3_gbk_to_gff3`)  
- Retrieval of corresponding NCBI taxonomic identifiers for the input data (`4_retrieve_taxids`)  
- Retrieval of contig names that differ between genbank and fasta files (`5_rename_contigs`)  
- Use of GenEra on the input data (`6_genera_archaea`)  
- Use of Dense on data generated by GenEra (`7_dense_archaea`)  
- Re-annotation of genomes (`8_re_annotate_genomes`)  

**Exploration of Results:**  
- General-purpose Python functions for analyses (`9_general_analysis_functions`)  
- Analysis of intergenic regions in annotated genomes (`10_analyse_intergenic`)  
- Conservation calculation of different types of genetic material across the phylogenetic tree (`11_calculate_conservation`)  
- Re-analysis with Diamond of 1000 random genes with a LUCA LCA according to GenEra (`12_reblast_rank1`)  
- Visualization of Dense results (`13_plot_dense_results`)  
- Retrieval of the origin of de novo genes from the non-coding region of the outgroup patch (`14_get_noncoding_match`)  
- Study of "missed" de novo genes due to synteny breaks (`15_explore_synteny_mismatches`)  
- Search for frameshifts within de novo genes (`16_look_for_frameshifts`)  
- Comparison of de novo gene sequences to other CDS using several descriptors (`17_compare_denovo_sequences`)  
- Clustering of genes lacking integrity (`18_clustering`) 
- Case study of an interesting organism (discarded for the report) (`19_case_study`)
