Your temporary files will be stored in /datas/ELIOTT/scripts/tmp_1638221_942

STARTING STEP 1: SEARCHING FOR HOMOLOGS WITHIN THE DATABASE USING DIAMOND
--------------------------------------------------
Matching the query genes against themselves
--------------------------------------------------
Searching for homologs against the DIAMOND database
DIAMOND results written!
--------------------------------------------------
Custom protein database found. Searching for homologs in the custom database using DIAMOND
--------------------------------------------------
Step 1 finished!
The DIAMOND/MMseqs2 table can be found in /datas/ELIOTT/scripts/tmp_1638221_942/1638221_Diamond_results.bout
This file is usually HUGE, please dispose of it if you no longer find it useful
It can still be used (-p) in case the user wants to re-run genEra while skipping step 1

STARTING STEP 2: GENERATING TAXONOMIC DATABASE FOR THE PHYLOSTRATIGRAPHIC ASSIGNMENT OF YOUR GENES
--------------------------------------------------
Running ncbitax2lin to generate a raw "ncbi_lineages" file from the NCBI taxdump

--------------------------------------------------
Finished generating a raw "ncbi_lineages" file named /datas/ELIOTT/archaea_data/genera/out/Thermococcus_AMTc11//ncbi_lineages_2025-02-23.csv
Keep it in case you want to run genEra with another species (-r)
--------------------------------------------------
Rearranging the raw "ncbi_lineages" file by taxonomic hierarchy
Extracting lineage information from /datas/ELIOTT/scripts/work/taxdump//fullnamelineage.dmp
--------------------------------------------------
Extracting all the lineages that match more than 10 percent of your query proteins
--------------------------------------------------
Collapsing the phylostrata that are not represented in your DIAMOND results
--------------------------------------------------
Generating the species-tailored database
--------------------------------------------------
Step 2 finished!
your species-tailored database can be found in /datas/ELIOTT/archaea_data/genera/out/Thermococcus_AMTc11//1638221_ncbi_lineages.csv
Keep this file in case you want to re-run step 3 of genEra with the same species (-c)

STARTING STEP 3: ASSIGNING AGES TO YOUR QUERY GENES WITH Erassignment
--------------------------------------------------
Splitting results per query gene using 32 threads
-------------------------------------------------- 
Importing and indexing files needed... | Sun Feb 23 06:48:35 2025
-------------------------------------------------- 
Filtering and exporting single gen hits ... | Sun Feb 23 06:55:53 2025
ANALYSIS COMPLETE !!! | Sun Feb 23 06:58:03 2025
Feed all these tmp files to Erassignment for saving a lot of time in STEP 3 
Thanks for using FASTSTEP3R 
--------------------------------------------------
Running Erassignment using 32 threads
--------------------------------------------------
Running mcl to define gene families
--------------------------------------------------
Establishing the age and number of gene-family founder events
--------------------------------------------------
Step 3 finished!
The age assignment for your individual genes can be found in /datas/ELIOTT/archaea_data/genera/out/Thermococcus_AMTc11//1638221_gene_ages.tsv
The possible ages for the genes with a taxonomic representativeness below 30 percent can be found in /datas/ELIOTT/archaea_data/genera/out/Thermococcus_AMTc11//1638221_ambiguous_phylostrata.tsv
The estimation of gene family founder events can be found in /datas/ELIOTT/archaea_data/genera/out/Thermococcus_AMTc11//1638221_founder_events.tsv
The number of individual genes that could be assigned to each phylostratum are summarized in /datas/ELIOTT/archaea_data/genera/out/Thermococcus_AMTc11//1638221_gene_age_summary.tsv
The number of of gene family founder events per phylostratum are summarized in /datas/ELIOTT/archaea_data/genera/out/Thermococcus_AMTc11//1638221_founder_summary.tsv
