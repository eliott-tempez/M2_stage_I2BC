Your temporary files will be stored in /datas/ELIOTT/scripts/tmp_272844_18939

STARTING STEP 1: SEARCHING FOR HOMOLOGS WITHIN THE DATABASE USING DIAMOND
--------------------------------------------------
Matching the query genes against themselves
--------------------------------------------------
Searching for homologs against the DIAMOND database
DIAMOND results written!
--------------------------------------------------
Custom protein database found. Searching for homologs in the custom database using DIAMOND
--------------------------------------------------
Step 1 finished!
The DIAMOND/MMseqs2 table can be found in /datas/ELIOTT/scripts/tmp_272844_18939/272844_Diamond_results.bout
This file is usually HUGE, please dispose of it if you no longer find it useful
It can still be used (-p) in case the user wants to re-run genEra while skipping step 1

STARTING STEP 2: GENERATING TAXONOMIC DATABASE FOR THE PHYLOSTRATIGRAPHIC ASSIGNMENT OF YOUR GENES
--------------------------------------------------
Running ncbitax2lin to generate a raw "ncbi_lineages" file from the NCBI taxdump

  ERROR: genEra could not find "nodes.dmp" and/or "names.dmp" within the specified taxdump directory:
  /datas/ELIOTT/new_taxdump.tar.gz/
  Please ensure that the route to the daxdump directory is correct, and that both files exist within that directory
  Or try to use an already existing "ncbi_lineages" file with argument -r
  The user can resume genEra from this step by including the DIAMOND/MMseqs2 file /datas/ELIOTT/scripts/tmp_272844_18939/272844_Diamond_results.bout in the pipeline (-p)
